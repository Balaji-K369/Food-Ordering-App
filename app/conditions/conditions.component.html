<p>Foodiyoo.com is a website operated by Foodiyoo India Food Industry Pvt Ltd company ("we" or "us" or "Foodiyoo"), incorporated and registered in the nation of india, whose registered office is at 17th floor, on the 4th floor, Adam Bazar building, Rice bazar road, Thrissur - Kerala. Our business is registered under the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) and the license No. 58213/2019. Foodiyoo is a business where the food is prepared by independent restaurants (our "Partner Restaurants") and delivered by us.
    The purpose of our Service is to provide a simple and convenient service to you, linking you to the Partner restaurant and menu of their choice and allowing you to order meals from them. Foodiyoo markets meals on behalf of our partner restaurants, concludes orders on their behalf and delivers the Meals to you.
    Foodiyoo offers an ordering and delivery service from our partner restaurants starting with Thrissur city. Each Partner Restaurant has a prescribed delivery area. This is to ensure that their Meals reach your door when they are at their best. If you live outside the delivery areas, a message will appear on screen notifying you that ordering online will not be possible. We do not accept orders from individuals to an area in which we do not have a Partner Restaurant. Operating hours will vary depending on local trading conditions and the availability of our Partner Restaurants. Please click on the relevant link to view the menus on our Service, and then click on your chosen menu which will provide you with the option to submit your order to your chosen Partner Restaurant.
    When you place an order through our Service, an email thanking you for your order and confirming your order has been received and accepted by the Partner Restaurant (the "Confirmation Email") will be sent to you by us on behalf of the Partner Restaurant. The contract for the supply of any Meal you order through us will be between you and the Partner Restaurant and will only be formed when you have been sent a Confirmation Email by us. Please ensure that you have given us a correct email address as this is how we will communicate with you about your order. Please also ensure that you provide an accurate address and telephone number to ensure that your Meals arrive at the correct location. If you do not open the door or respond to telephonic correspondence within 5 minutes of our delivery drivers physically reaching your address, we reserve the right to leave the premises, and you will be charged for the Meal. Foodiyoo seeks to provide a quality service and will be the first contact in the event there is a problem with your Meal either in regards to food quality and/or temperature. We do monitor our Partner Restaurants very closely and it is of utmost importance to us that they comply with our standards and help us to maintain our reputation. Change or Add item in any placed orders should be communicated through Foodiyoo Call Center or via email. Foodiyoo will not be responsible if the user contacts the restaurant through the restaurant channel and climbs for mismatch with order after the delivery. Please let us know if you have any comments relating to our Partner Restaurants or in respect of the Meals.
